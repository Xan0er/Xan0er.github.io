Welcome to my another CTF writeup. I participated in the ***Really Awesome CTF 2021*** this weekend. I was not able to solve much of the challenges due to lack of time. However, I was able to solve some of the OSINT challenges. So enjoy the writeups for these challenges.

In this challenge, we are given an image which looks like a cafe image. We can see the name of the cafe written outside the building. After searching this name, I found the location of this cafe. And also, you can search the image also and you will find the name of this cafe. 

After entering the correct location in CTF Infrastructure, this challenge was solved.

In this challenge, we can an image in which we can see the a road. If you look closely, you'll see a menu board in the image for the ***Bistro 24 Cafe***. Also, if you'll read closely, you will find that the language which is used in this board is ***Portuguese***. After finding that I knew that this cafe must be located in the Portugal or in Spain country. After some searching around on google, I found that this cafe is located in Spain.

After selecting this cafe location, the challenge was solved.
